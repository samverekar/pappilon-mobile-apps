# Pappilon — Early Mobile Applications (Symbian Era, 2008–2010)

## Company Context

Pappilon was an early mobile product studio based in Bangalore, operating in the pre–app store era when Symbian dominated smartphone deployments in India.

At the time, fewer than a handful of companies in the country had the capability to design and ship consumer-grade mobile applications on Symbian devices. Pappilon was one of these early specialists.

The company was later acquihired for a brief period by Percept Knorigin.
